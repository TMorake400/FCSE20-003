The Monte Carlo tennis championship was first held in 1897 and became an 'open' event in 1969. From 1970 to 1972 and from 1978 all the way to 1989, it was a major tournament of the Grand Prix Tour as part of the Grand Prix Super Series top tier events. In 1973, the tournament formed part of Rothmans Spring Mediterranean Circuit. From 1974 to 1977 the tournament was part of the World Championship Tennis (WCT) circuit.
In 1990, it became an ATP Championship Series Single Week tennis event and from 2009, Monte Carlo became the only ATP Tour Masters 1000 tournament not to have a mandatory player commitment. Most of the top players still choose to play the event despite this status.
