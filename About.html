<br>HISTORY<br>

<p>
Monaco was originally called Monoikos (Greek) after the temple of Hercules Monoikos, located in the Phocaean colony of the 6th century BCE. During its history, Monoikos (Monaco) changed hands numerous times until it became known as Monaco in the Middle Ages. Some of the city walls and original structures still remain to this day. It was here that the Phocaeans of Massalia (now Marseille) founded the colony of Monoikos in the 6th century BC. Monoikos was associated with Hercules who was worshipped as Hercules Monoecus.
On June 10th of 1215, a detachment of Ghibellines led by Fulco del Cassello began the construction of a fortress on the rock of Monaco in order to make it a strategic military position and a means of controlling the area. They also established dwellings at the base of the rock to support the garrisons. In order to  attract inhabitants of Genoa and the surrounding towns,they offered land and exempted newcomers from taxes.
On January 8th 1297, Francois Grimaldi, a descendant of Otto Cancella, consul of Genoa in 1133 took over the fortress, although he had disguised himself as a Franciscan monk to enter, before opening the gates to his soldiers. This gave rise to his nickname Malizia(Malice) and is why the arms of Monaco bear two Franciscans armed with a sword.
